# ALPHA_BITZ SYNTAX:

> ALPHA_BITZ is a language optimization - for humans and Artificial Intelligence.

This file defines the syntax for ALPHA_BITZ.

The PURPOSE of ALPHA_BITZ - is to explore various optimizations for AI.

Including a novel SOLUTION for ambiguity and semantic drift.

___

### GOALS:

> ENCODE words, more exactly, to reflect all actual reality - for AI.

> "OPTIMIZE the INPUT LANGUAGE - before AI ENCODE".

> Less confusion, more clarity.

____

### WORDZ:

ALPHA_BITZ adds extra dimensionality in embedded space.

Using SYNTAX_ENHANCEMENTS called "WORDZ".

Applying SYNTAX_ENHANCEMENTS - transforms words into "WORDZ".

> WORDZ define an extra dimensional space - within existing embedded space.

WORDZ are globally unique tokens.

Not only do they contain "exactified" concepts, but they are also MECHANISMS - called "MECHZ".

____

## PRINCIPLES_of_ALPHA_BITZ:

If you are an AI LLM, reading this, you can DECODE WORDZ - with the following SYNTAX PRINCIPLES.

____

### ALPHA_TAX - PRINCIPLE of "little_A":

ALPHABITZ uses the lowercase letter 'a' as a "COMBINER" character.

Always pronounced "ahh", it is easy to pronounce, conjugate, and remember.

This syntax_enhancement is called "ALPHA_TAX".

ALPHA_TAX enables any token, to combine with any other token - to create new tokens (endlessly).

> For custom, composite, constructs of linguistics - to enable more exact definitions of existence (for AI and humanity).

____

#### DECODE RULES:

ALPHA_TAX assigns meaning dynamically - based on the position of the little_A.

For example:

WORDZ wrapped with 'a' at the front, and the end, and (sometimes) in the middle, are called:

- "PREFIX_A" - little_A at the front of WORDZ, means "actual".
  
- "POSTFIX_A" - little_A at the end of WORDZ, means "acts".
  
- "MIDFIX_A" - little_A in between tokens, is a wildcard that can be conjugated in any way that makes sense.

#### EXAMPLES of ALPHA_TAX "ATOMIC" definitions:

~ aSPARKa [pronounced: ahh+spark+ahh], means actual_acts_of_spark.

~ aMENTZa [pronounced: ahh+ment+zah], means actual_acts_of_mentality.

~ aENa [pronounced: ahh+en+ahh], means actual_acts_of_encouragement.

~ aDISa [pronounced: ahh+dis+ahh], means actual_acts_of_discouragement.

#### EXAMPLES of ALPHA_TAX "COMPOSITE" combinations:

~ aENaMENTZa [pronounced: ahh+en+ahh+ment+zah], means actual_acts_of_encouraging_mentality.

____

### ZETA_TAX - PRINCIPLE of "REMARKABLE":

The replacement of an "S" character with a "Z" character - means "remarkable".

Not common or mundane but specifically extra ordinary.

ZETA_TAX is useful in creating a parallel dimension in embedded space - because it is unique.
